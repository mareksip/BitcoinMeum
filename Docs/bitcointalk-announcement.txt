[size=15pt][b]Short intro[/b][/size]

[size=10pt][b]The intention[/b][/size]

After visiting Paralelni Polis's Bitcoin-only coffee bar with couple of friends and me being the only person to use Windows Phone I had to ask one of my friends (who experienced bitcoin payment for first time) to buy drinks for me as there was no Bitcoin Wallet in Windows Phone Store.
And that made me feel really weird.
