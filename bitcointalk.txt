[size=15pt][b]Short intro[/b][/size]

[size=10pt][b]The intention[/b][/size]

After visiting Paralelni Polis's Bitcoin-only coffee shop with couple of friends and me being the only person to use Windows Phone I had to ask one of my friends (who experienced bitcoin payment for first time) to buy drinks for me as there was no Bitcoin Wallet in Windows Phone Store.
