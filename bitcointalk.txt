[size=15pt][b]Short intro[/b][/size]

[size=10pt][b]The intention[/b][/size]

After visiting Paralelni Polis's Bitcoin-only coffee shop with couple of friends and me being the only person to use Windows Phone I had to ask one of my friends (who experienced bitcoin payment for first time) to buy drinks for me as there was no Bitcoin Wallet in Windows Phone Store.

Miguel Rachefort's Bitcoin (probably hidden from store due to Microsoft certification policies OR outdated Blockchain API usage)

[size=10pt][b]Why[/b][/size]

[list]
[li]Personal use[/li]
[li]Community expansion[/li]
[li]Does Microsoft allow Bitcoin wallets in its Stores? [i]Nobody really knows [/i][/li]
[li]Windows Phone has roughly above 3% market share of Smartphone OS. It is uncomparable to Android's 80% but it is still large portion of cell phones running this OS and community cannot expand without atleast minor support here.[/li]
[/list]

[i]Wanna go really mainstream? You need to have support for [b]any device[/b].[/i]
